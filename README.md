# Google Play Store Apps

## Project Overview
Google Play store has huge numbers of Apps. It allows users to search for Apps, check reviews, install Apps and rate Apps. Investigating these Apps can help the Apps publishers in making there decisions when developing Apps. In this notebook, I will analyze a dataset of Google Play store that contains data of 2018.

The dataset contains 13 features:

	- App: Application name

	- Price: Price of the app
	- Content Rating: Age group the app is targeted at - Children / Mature 21+ / Adult
